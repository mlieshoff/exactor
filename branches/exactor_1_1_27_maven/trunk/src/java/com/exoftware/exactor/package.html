        <p>Provides the core classes of the EXACTOR framework.</p>
        <p>The main concepts are Command and Script. A command typically
        represents a verb phrase in the language of the application domain. Commands
        are created by subclassing the <code>Command</code> class and implementing the
        domain specific details. A command may have a number of Parameters.</p>
        <p>A script represents a collection of commands grouped together to perform and
        check some application functionality. In eXtreme Programming this would be an acceptance
        test for a story. Scripts are grouped together to run in a ExecutionSet which may have
        ExecutionSetListeners added to it to report on the scripts and commands being executed.</p>
