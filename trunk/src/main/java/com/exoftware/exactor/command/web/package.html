        <p>Provides command classes for interacting with web sites.</p>
        <p>The commands provided wrap most of the assertions available in
           the jwebunit framework. Assertions that have array parameters or
           framework object parameters, such as <code>net.sourceforge.jwebunit.ExpectedTable</code>, are ommited.</p>
        <p>Assertions that are overloaded are represented by a single command which delegates
           to the appropriate assertion based on the number of parameters supplied.</p>
