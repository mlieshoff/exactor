= Annotated commands =

Command classes can define parameters with assigned annotations. The inherited class *AnnotatedCommand* resolves and set this parameters by calling a method named *setUp()*. Manually resolving is not more necessary.

public class OrderBookCommand {
   @Param(namespace=FooParameters.class, name="USER_ID")
   private int user;
   @Param(namespace=FooParameters.class, name="BOOK")
   private Book book;
   @Param(namespace=FooParameters.class, name="TRACK", type=ParameterType.OPTIONAL)
   private boolean tracking;
}
}}}

This is the class for doing something with a book. There is a member *userId*, an object of type book and one optional member called *tracking*.
